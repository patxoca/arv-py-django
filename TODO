* TODOs

* Already done

** DONE push the point

When visition/jumping to other files it may be useful to push the
point in order to quickly return to the current file.

** DONE add simple templating suport

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-08 dt. 10:02] \\
     s-format will do the trick.

Sometimes it might be useful to iterate over values returned by djira
(the fiels of a model for example) inserting some content for each of
them. Some kind of templating is required.
